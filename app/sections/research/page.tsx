      title: "Photonics",
      description:
        "My work in photonics focuses on light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. I investigate how nanostructured materials can manipulate light in ways that aren't possible with conventional optics. This includes research on photonic crystals, plasmonic structures, and metamaterials that can control the flow of light with unprecedented precision.",

      title: "Holography",
      description:
        "My holography research centers on computer-generated holography and advanced display systems. I develop algorithms and optical configurations that can generate high-quality holographic images in real-time. This includes work on phase-only spatial light modulators, holographic projection systems, and methods for reducing computational complexity in hologram generation.",

      title: "3D Graphics",
      description:
        "In the realm of 3D graphics, I explore real-time rendering techniques and computational imaging methods that can enhance the realism and interactivity of three-dimensional visual content. My work bridges the gap between computer graphics and physical optics, seeking ways to leverage the strengths of both fields for more immersive visual experiences.",

      title: "Metasurfaces",
      description:
        "My research on metasurfaces involves designing and characterizing engineered surfaces for wavefront manipulation. These ultrathin optical components can perform complex optical functions that traditionally required bulky elements. I investigate both the fundamental physics of metasurfaces and their applications in imaging, sensing, and display technologies.",
